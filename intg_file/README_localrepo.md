## 🧩 **Phase 3: Local Integration Testing (Completed ✅)**

### Overview  
In this phase, the **BridgeX** framework was tested with **locally sourced data** (using the `os` module and a simulated local repository).  
The goal was to ensure that data from a local source could be seamlessly integrated into the database layer through the `DataIntegrator` and `DatabaseClient` modules — validating the system’s internal data flow before connecting to real-world APIs.

### Implementation Details  
- **Classes Tested:** `LocalRepo`, `DatabaseClient`, and `DataIntegrator`  
- **Testing Framework:** `pytest`  
- **Database Used:** `SQLite (test_local_database.db)`  
- **Data Source:** Local repository (simulated file-based dataset)  
- **Testing Objective:** Validate successful data extraction, transformation, and persistence in the local test database.

### Test Example  
```python
def test_integrate_data_integrator():
    """Integration test for DataIntegrator with real LocalRepo and DatabaseClient"""
    local_repo = LocalRepo()
    db_client = DatabaseClient("test_local_database.db")
    server = DataIntegrator(local_repo, db_client)

    df = server.integrate_data()

   #asserting not an empty dataframe is returned
    assert not df.empty

    # asserting a dataframe is returned
    assert isinstances(df, pd.DataFrame)	

    #asserting the instances of expected column
     expected_col= ['InvoiceNo', 'StockCode', 'Description']

     assert all(col in df.columns for col in df.columns)
```

### Results  
✅ **Status:** All local integration tests passed successfully.  
🔍 **Validation:** Data was accurately retrieved from the local repository and persisted into the SQLite database without conflicts or schema mismatches.

## 🌐 **Next Phase: API Integration Testing (In Progress 🔄)**

### Objective  
To extend the integration framework by connecting **BridgeX** to a **real API data source**, ensuring that external API responses can be fetched, processed, and stored in the same database pipeline with stability and consistency.

### Upcoming Tasks  
- Configure real API endpoints and credentials.  
- Modify the `APIClient` to handle live data fetching and transformation.  
- Conduct end-to-end tests for API → Database pipeline.  
- Implement response validation and error-handling for external data.
